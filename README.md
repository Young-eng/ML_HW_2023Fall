## ML Homework 2023Fall 

Here are some codes that I used for my PAML courses, SVM_classification.py is used for classify CIFAR-10 for the final project.

Thanks for [LemuelKL's](https://github.com/LemuelKL/CIFAR10-HOG-PCA-SVM), [Osamakhaan's](https://github.com/osamakhaan/CIFAR-10-Image-Classification) and [Nana0606's](https://github.com/Nana0606/autoencoder) codes, my codes are based on their wonderful jobs, I add Autoencoder to do dimensionality reduction and feature extraction compared to HOG + PCA.

the dataset is [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
